Party Palace Customer Experience Site  
  
  
  
  
  -Hello and welcome to the new customer experience site for Party Palace! This repository contains the information for the installation and functionality of the site for the Party Palace party supply retail store. The program itself was created for the Salesforce platform and is composed of Aura Components; written in Apex, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. An earlier version of the customer experience was written with Visualforce pages; this product has migrated those elements and added a considerable amount of additional functionality. Below you are able to see a search component that dynamically adjusts to user selections, a system for leaving ratings and reviews, and a shopping cart and checkout area
